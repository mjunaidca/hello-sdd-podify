# Feature Specification: Modern Podcast Website

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-am-building`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I am building a modern podcast website. I want it to look long sleek, something that would standout. Should have a landing page with one featured episode, an about page and a FAQ page. Should have 20 episodes, and the data is mocked - you do not need to pull anything from any real  feed"

> Constitution Alignment: Static-first delivery, mocked data only (no live feeds), accessibility and performance gates apply to Home, About, FAQ, and Episode routes.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A visitor arrives at the podcast website to quickly understand the show, play a featured episode, browse recent episodes, and find answers about the show/hosts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a first-time visitor on the landing page, **When** they view the hero section, **Then** they see the featured episode with title, cover art, short description, and a clear play button.
2. **Given** a visitor on the landing page, **When** they scroll, **Then** they see a grid/list of 20 episodes with essential metadata (title, number, duration, publish date) and can navigate to an episode detail page.
3. **Given** a visitor on any page, **When** they open the main navigation, **Then** they can access links to Home, About, and FAQ pages.
4. **Given** a visitor on the About page, **When** they read the content, **Then** they understand the show's mission and the hosts' bios.
5. **Given** a visitor on the FAQ page, **When** they browse questions, **Then** they can expand/collapse answers and find contact or feedback guidance.
6. **Given** a visitor on an episode detail page, **When** they press play, **Then** the audio player starts playback and displays episode metadata.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an episode's audio is unavailable? ‚Üí Show a non-blocking error and keep the page functional.
- How does the site handle no JavaScript? ‚Üí Core content remains visible; native audio element renders and plays. Interactive enhancements (search/filter, FAQ collapse, animated hero) gracefully degrade.
- What happens on very slow connections? ‚Üí Defer non-critical assets; keep first meaningful paint focused on hero/featured episode.
- How should the site behave on very small screens? ‚Üí Content and controls remain usable; player controls remain accessible.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The site MUST include four routes: Home (landing), About, FAQ, and Episode Detail.
- **FR-002**: The Home page MUST display a single featured episode with title, description, cover art, and a prominent play action.
- **FR-003**: The Home page MUST list exactly 20 episodes with basic metadata and link to each episode detail.
- **FR-004**: The About page MUST present the show's purpose and brief host bios.
- **FR-005**: The FAQ page MUST present a list of questions with collapsible answers.
- **FR-006**: The Episode Detail page MUST display title, number, description, duration, publish date, cover art, and an audio player with play/pause/seek.
- **FR-007**: The site MUST use mocked data for all episodes and MUST NOT fetch from any live feed.
- **FR-008**: The global navigation MUST provide direct access to Home, About, and FAQ from all pages.
- **FR-009**: The design MUST present a modern, sleek aesthetic that visually stands out, including a bold hero and consistent typography.
- **FR-010**: The site MUST provide accessible controls (keyboard navigable, labeled controls) for the audio player and navigation.

Additional decisions (resolved assumptions):
- **FR-011**: Visual direction is a dark theme with high-contrast typography and an electric blue accent; bold hero section with large type and immersive cover art.
- **FR-012**: Episode detail includes show notes and an optional transcript section; when transcript is unavailable, display a "Transcript coming soon" notice.
- **FR-013**: Client-side search/filter by episode title and number is available on the Home page; no network requests required.
- **FR-014**: Social sharing links are present on episode detail: X/Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Copy Link.
- **FR-015**: Accessibility: keyboard operable audio controls, visible focus states, ARIA labels, and color contrast meeting WCAG AA.
- **FR-016**: No-JS baseline: content and basic audio playback work without JavaScript; interactive enhancements degrade gracefully.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Episode**: number, title, description, duration, publishDate, coverImageUrl, audioUrl, slug, featured (boolean)
- **FAQItem**: question, answer, category (optional), order
- **Host**: name, bio, avatarUrl (optional)
